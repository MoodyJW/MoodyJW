  <li>
    The first time I wrote code was sometime in the late 90s. I customized my AOL 3.0 profile using HTML.

  <li>
    The second time I wrote code was during the summer of 2019 when I started learning Python.
  </li>
  <li>
    I got a job near the end of 2019 working with Angular, which I'd never used...

    Somehow I still have that job!
