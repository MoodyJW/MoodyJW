<li>The first time I wrote code was sometime in the late 90s. I customized my AOL 3.0 profile using HTML.</li>

The second time I wrote code was during the summer of 2019 when I started learning Python :snake:

I got a job near the end of 2019 working with Angular, which was new to me

Somehow I still have that job!
