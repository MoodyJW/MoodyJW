   <p>I started coding in the late 90s when I customized my AOL 3.0 profile. Afterwards, I took a ~20 year break.
   During the summer of 2019 I started learning Python and before 2020 I landed a 6 month contract working mostly with TypeScript/Angular. I barely knew    JavaScript, which I explained in the interview, but here I am two years later and they're still paying me.</p>
